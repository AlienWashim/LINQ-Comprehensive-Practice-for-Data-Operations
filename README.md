# LINQ Comprehensive Practice for Data Operations - Guided by Microsoft
This repository contains my practice code and also code collected from MS for Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) 
guided by Microsoft Learn. LINQ simplifies querying data sources such as collections, databases, and XML documents directly within C#,
making it easier to write clean, readable, and efficient code.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned:
* Query Expression Syntax: Using LINQ to filter, order, and group data with a declarative syntax.
* IQueryable LINQ Providers: Understanding how LINQ interacts with various data sources like databases, XML, and more.
* Deferred Execution: LINQ queries are executed only when the result is enumerated, enabling optimized performance.
* Types of LINQ Queries: How to use both method and query syntax for querying collections and databases.

## Key Features:
* Filtering Data with Where to select specific elements.
* Sorting Data using OrderBy, ThenBy.
* Grouping Data with GroupBy to organize related elements.
* Aggregation with methods like Count, Sum, Max, Min.
* Joining multiple data sources efficiently with Join.

I believe there's always more to learn and explore, so keep learning and exploring.
